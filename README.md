## Steam Deck
Switch to the desktop and open the application menu  
Right click the Jagex Launcher and select add to Steam, a new shortcut will be added to your library under `NON-STEAM`  

If you are using RuneLite you can import a [properties file](https://github.com/TormStorm/jagex-launcher-linux/blob/main/resources/steamdeck-settings.properties) or log in to set it up automatically  
While in desktop mode open the Jagex Launcher and start RuneLite  

If you want to import a properties file open the configuration menu and select the profiles tab  
Click `import profile` navigate to your properties file and open it   

If you have a RuneLite account click the login button at the bottom right of your client  
A browser will open where you will be able to sign in and automatically import your profiles   

To set up your controls rename the Steam entry to `RuneScape` if playing RuneScape or `OSRS` if playing Old School RuneScape  
Now you can go into the game's controller settings and browse community layouts or make your own   

If you are using [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) you can download a plugin called `SteamGridDB` to add custom artwork to your steam entry
