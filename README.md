## Official Jagex Launcher

There are multiple Flatpaks available, we recommend using this one from USA-RedDragon:
```
curl -fSsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USA-RedDragon/jagex-launcher-flatpak/main/install.sh | bash
```
For more information visit USA-RedDragon's [GitHub page](https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/jagex-launcher-flatpak)<br>

Alternatively you can use nmlynch94's Flatpak:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmlynch94/com.jagexlauncher.JagexLauncher/main/install-jagex-launcher.sh && bash install-jagex-launcher.sh && rm install-jagex-launcher.sh
```

## Third-party launcher

If you want to use a native third-party launcher you can install Bolt:<br>
```
flatpak install flathub com.adamcake.Bolt
```

## Steam Deck

Open the application menu and right click on "Jagex Launcher" in the "Games" category  
Select "Add to Steam"  
Rename the Steam entry to RuneScape if playing RuneScape or OSRS if playing Old School RuneScape  
Switch to Gaming Mode by logging out  
Your new shortcut should now be in your library under "Non-Steam"  
After launching, press the steam button and you can browse community layouts under "Controller Settings" to configure your controls
